# Savitri Network Values

## Introduction

Values are the bridge between principles and action. While our principles define what we believe, our values guide how we turn those beliefs into daily decisions, product features, and community interactions. These values are practical, actionable, and embedded in every aspect of Savitri Network.

## Core Values

### 1. User Sovereignty

**What it means**: Users have absolute control over their digital existence.

**Daily application**:
- **Product Design**: Every feature prioritizes user control over convenience
- **Technical Architecture**: Private keys give users ultimate authority
- **Community Guidelines**: Users decide what content and interactions they want
- **Business Decisions**: We never compromise user control for profit

**Decision framework**:
- Does this give users more control?
- Are we taking away any user agency?
- Can users opt out if they choose?
- Are we being transparent about data usage?

**Real-world examples**:
- Wallet interfaces that never expose private keys
- Privacy settings that are opt-in rather than opt-out
- User-controlled data sharing with granular permissions
- Censorship-resistant transaction processing

### 2. Radical Transparency

**What it means**: Everything about the network should be open and verifiable.

**Daily application**:
- **Code Development**: All core code is open source and auditable
- **Financial Operations**: Network fees and rewards are publicly visible
- **Governance Processes**: All decisions and discussions are public
- **Security Practices**: Vulnerabilities and fixes are disclosed promptly

**Decision framework**:
- Is this decision transparent to users?
- Can users verify what we're claiming?
- Are we hiding anything that affects users?
- Would we be comfortable if this were front-page news?

**Real-world examples**:
- Public dashboard showing network metrics and health
- Open governance forums where anyone can participate
- Transparent fee structures and reward calculations
- Public security audits and bug bounty programs

### 3. Economic Justice

**What it means**: Economic systems should be fair and accessible to everyone.

### 8. Privacy by Default

**What it means**: Privacy should be the default, not an optional feature.

**Daily application**:
- **Data Collection**: We collect only what is absolutely necessary
- **Data Storage**: Personal data is encrypted and minimized
- **Data Sharing**: Users control all data sharing decisions
- **Communication**: All communications are encrypted by default

**Decision framework**:
- Are we collecting more data than necessary?
- Is user data properly protected?
- Do users have control over their data?
- Could this design be more privacy-preserving?

**Real-world examples**:
- Zero-knowledge proofs for private transactions
- Minimal data collection in applications
- User-controlled data sharing with explicit consent

## Value Conflicts and Resolution

### Common Conflicts

#### Speed vs. Security
**Conflict**: Moving quickly vs. being thorough and secure
**Resolution**: Security always wins. We move thoughtfully and deliberately.

#### Growth vs. Decentralization
**Conflict**: Rapid user growth vs. maintaining decentralization
**Resolution**: Decentralization first. Growth that compromises decentralization is rejected.

#### Innovation vs. Stability
**Conflict**: Trying new things vs. maintaining network stability
**Resolution**: Stability for core protocol, innovation on the edges.

#### Profit vs. User Sovereignty
**Conflict**: Making money vs. protecting user control
**Resolution**: User sovereignty always wins. Profit follows value creation.

### Resolution Framework

When values conflict, we use this framework:

1. **Identify Core Values**: Which fundamental values are involved?
2. **Assess Impact**: What are the consequences of each choice?
3. **Consult Community**: What does the community think?
4. **Make Decision**: Choose the option that best serves our mission
5. **Explain Rationale**: Communicate the decision and reasoning clearly
6. **Monitor Results**: Track outcomes and be ready to adjust
